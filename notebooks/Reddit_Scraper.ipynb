Once dropped with USPS item is no longer under my control and out of my hands. I will provide tracking. Insurance and required signature can be added upon request. Drop a comment and send me a chat. Let's make some deals. Thanks for looking.\"},\n",

Not available as a standalone sale.\\n\\n# Trades\\n\\nI'm in the market for the following and open to reasonable trade offers:\\n\\n* 1986 1oz AGE (raw)\\n* Fractional AGEs (any year, any denomination)\\n* ASE Proofs in OGP w/ CoA\\n* 5oz silver rounds/coins (Aztec, Incuse Indian, Perth Mint, Libs, ATBs, anything else interesting)\\n\\n# Shipping Costs:\\n\\n$6 for ground, $10 for priority\\n\\n# Trust and shipping:\\n\\nI understand it is reasonable to be hesitant and cautious about purchasing from a new seller. Although I feel like I have enough flair to demonstrate I'm invested in the community, I want to continue building trust and credibility so here is what I'll agree to:\\n\\n* At my discretion I'll ship first for orders of **fractional gold** to community members with 50+ sellers flair or 100+ total flair or if I have purchased from you previously.\\n* I won't ship first for full ounces but am open to in-person transaction in the SF Bay Area if that will make you feel more comfortable.\\n* I'm open to go through a middle man if you identify one and cover their tip. We each pay our own shipping.\"},\n",

No problem. All shipping is by USPS Priority Mail - Small Flat Rate Box (SFRB) (unless a larger sized box is required). Shipping is $12.50 for all orders ***unless*** the listing is labeled as \"Shipped\". If the listing is labeled as \"Shipped\" then shipping is included in the price. $12.50 is the *average cost* of postage for all the orders that I\\'ve completed. I just charge everyone the average cost since that makes this whole ordering process go as fast as possible for both parties. If you think that I\\'m overcharging you, then I can calculate the shipping cost for your particular address and weight of package. However, that will require that you wait an extra 10 minutes while I do the shipping calculations. Is the *possibility* of saving $2.00 worth 10 minutes of your time? That\\'s your decision to make.\\n\\nI accept payment by Zelle or Venmo. Zelle is preferred since it\\'s an instantaneous transfer. PPFF and Cash App too if that\\'s all that you have. Please do not put any notes in the notes section. Just leave blank, if possible. If a note or comment is required for a transaction, then just enter \"...\". Thank you.\\n\\nAll items will be securely and discreetly packaged and hand delivered to the USPS clerk. Once hand delivered to the USPS clerk and scanned into their system, my responsibility for the package ends. If you have any doubt about the USPS successfully delivering your package without the contents being lost or stolen in transit, then insurance is available for a nominal fee. If porch pirates are active in your neighborhood then Signature Required (direct handoff from the USPS mail carrier) is available for an additional $3.75.\\n\\nNote: Please be sure to comment \"Chat\" in this ad. before using Chat. The moderators have made this a requirement for buying and selling in this subreddit. I cannot engage in chat without the \"Chat\" comment.

The pieces are composed of sterling silver (the knives have sterling handles and steel blades).\\n\\nImages are here: [https://imgur.com/a/bawqZHC](https://imgur.com/a/bawqZHC)\\n\\n\\\\- Weight of the sterling pieces is approximately 2200 grams  \\n\\\\- Weigh of the knives is approximately 970 grams  \\n\\\\- I estimate the total pure silver content to be a bit over 72 troy ounces.  \\n\\\\- I am offering this set up for $2850.\\n\\nI have sold through other channels, but I am new here.\\n\\n\\\\----------------------\\n\\nEach place setting consists of eight pieces: dinner fork, salad fork, hors d'oeuvres fork, table spoon, teaspoon, iced-tea spoon, dinner knife, and bread knife. The set also includes six serving pieces: solid serving spoon, slotted serving spoon, serving fork, sauce ladle, sugar spoon, jelly spoon, and master butter knife.

I was told that this set was never used… however, the case was damaged, and the pieces were stored in a cardboard carton for some years - even if not used, there are some marks on some of the pieces. The sugar spoon, in particular, has some scratching across its bowl. All-in-all, the set is in very excellent condition.\\n\\n\\\\----------------------\\n\\nThe name Gorham is synonymous with high-end silver, being one of America’s the most sought after producers since being established in the 1830s (until it was taken over and renamed in 2005).\\n\\nGorham's Strasbourg pattern was introduced in 1897, and is recognized as one of the most sought-after high-end flatware patterns.

I know it’s a key date and not easy to find, so I’m happy to pay a fair price based on condition and rarity.\\n\\nHelp me complete the set and bring balance to my silver universe 🙏\\n\\nThanks and happy stacking!\\n\\n\\\\-rooneyskywalker🛸'},\n",

No problem. All shipping is by USPS Priority Mail - Small Flat Rate Box (SFRB) (unless a larger sized box is required). Shipping is $12.50 for all orders ***unless*** the listing is labeled as \"Shipped\". If the listing is labeled as \"Shipped\" then shipping is included in the price. $12.50 is the *average cost* of postage for all the orders that I\\'ve completed. I just charge everyone the average cost since that makes this whole ordering process go as fast as possible for both parties. If you think that I\\'m overcharging you, then I can calculate the shipping cost for your particular address and weight of package. However, that will require that you wait an extra 10 minutes while I do the shipping calculations. Is the *possibility* of saving $2.00 worth 10 minutes of your time? That\\'s your decision to make.\\n\\nI accept payment by Zelle or Venmo. Zelle is preferred since it\\'s an instantaneous transfer. PPFF and Cash App too if that\\'s all that you have. Please do not put any notes in the notes section. Just leave blank, if possible. If a note or comment is required for a transaction, then just enter \"...\". Thank you.\\n\\nAll items will be securely and discreetly packaged and hand delivered to the USPS clerk. Once hand delivered to the USPS clerk and scanned into their system, my responsibility for the package ends. If you have any doubt about the USPS successfully delivering your package without the contents being lost or stolen in transit, then insurance is available for a nominal fee. If porch pirates are active in your neighborhood then Signature Required (direct handoff from the USPS mail carrier) is available for an additional $3.75.\\n\\nNote: Please be sure to comment \"Chat\" in this ad. before using Chat.

Checks and Money orders need to fully clear first before I ship anything.\\n\\nUSA SHIPPING - $5-16. Insurance at your request, charged at cost. I pack and ship like I like to receive it. Nicely secured, padded, and no jingling. I hand deliver to post office for scanning and will provide tracking.\\n\\nUSA RESPONSIBILITY - It ends when the package shows delivered in tracking. If you have a problem with porch pirates I recommend signature confirmation, which I can provide at cost. All items verified on a Sigma at my LCS. I stand behind what I sell 100%.\\n\\nCANADA - I accept WISE (+ 1.13 USD transfer fee) & PPFF for payment. I will only sell pure bullion to avoid you needing to pay customs fees. I ship via UPS for now until Canada Post is well out of their strike issues. I will be declaring exactly what is inside the package and I do my customs invoices showing the items inside are a gift. MY RESPONSIBILITY ENDS WHEN I DROP IT AT UPS. However I will help get it through customs to the best of my abilities! Any and all fees that customs decides may be due are paid by you, the buyer. If you would like to provide your own shipping label and invoice I am happy to oblige and will provide weights and measurements so you can do that.\\n\\nRISKY SHIP - responsibility ends when I hand it to a postal clerk for scanning.\\n\\nSECURITY - All my proof pictures will contain my ZENPATHFINDER silver round name badge that u/UnresolvedEgo made. I love it. You should consider a name badge of your own if you sell. I am no dummy and any \"mod\" that says I am banned and they need my password to see my chats gets a nice teabagging pic and is reported. I will always use my custom name tag to provide proof via chat, just ask. I have 2FA on my account. LETS KEEP THIS SUB SAFE!'},\n",

No problem. All shipping is by USPS Priority Mail - Small Flat Rate Box (SFRB) (unless a larger sized box is required). Shipping is $12.50 for all orders ***unless*** the listing is labeled as \"Shipped\". If the listing is labeled as \"Shipped\" then shipping is included in the price. $12.50 is the *average cost* of postage for all the orders that I\\'ve completed. I just charge everyone the average cost since that makes this whole ordering process go as fast as possible for both parties. If you think that I\\'m overcharging you, then I can calculate the shipping cost for your particular address and eight of package. However, that will require that you wait an extra 10 minutes while I do the shipping calculations. Is the *possibility* of saving $2.00 worth 10 minutes of your time? That\\'s your decision to make.\\n\\nI accept payment by Zelle or Venmo. Zelle is preferred since it\\'s an instantaneous transfer. PPFF and Cash App too if that\\'s all that you have. Please do not put any notes in the notes section. Just leave blank, if possible. If a note or comment is required for a transaction, then just enter \"...\". Thank you.\\n\\nAll items will be securely and discreetly packaged and hand delivered to the USPS clerk. Once hand delivered to the USPS clerk and scanned into their system, my responsibility for the package ends. If you have any doubt about the USPS successfully delivering your package without the contents being lost or stolen in transit, then insurance is available for a nominal fee. If porch pirates are active in your neighborhood then Signature Required (direct handoff from the USPS mail carrier) is available for an additional $3.75.\\n\\nNote: Please be sure to comment \"Chat\" in this ad. before using Chat.

MY RESPONSIBILITY ENDS WHEN I DROP IT AT UPS. However I will help get it through customs to the best of my abilities! Any and all fees that customs decides may be due are paid by you, the buyer.

I will always use my custom name tag to provide proof via chat, just ask. I have 2FA on my account. LETS KEEP THIS SUB SAFE!'},\n",

I will do my part to make sure the package and its contents will arrive safely but once I hand off the package all responsibility for delivery is between the buyer and USPS. I have never had a package go missing but if it happens I will do everything I can to assist you in your claim. I take photos of the items, the shipping label, and the package before I send it and will always keep the receipt from when I hand it off.\\n\\nI am not a professional coin grader. My grading estimates are just that. Use pictures and/or video to judge for yourself. If the condition is a concern I will upload more videos/photos of any coin listed so you can fully inspect it prior to any money changing hands. I want you to know exactly what you are getting for your collection so there are no misunderstandings. I would rather take the time to make sure you will be happy with your purchase than rush into a sale.\\n\\nPlease no time wasters. I do not guarantee that I will answer PMs in the order received. I will answer them in whatever order I see fit which may be out of order. BIN does not guarantee order being fulfilled. If I don’t get timely responses or timely payment, I will sell the coins/notes to the next interested party. Reasonable offers are welcome, but I don’t have much room, if any, to negotiate on smaller purchases. Offers of spot will not be tolerated. If I want to sell it at spot, it will be listed as such.\\n\\nIf payment is not made in a reasonably timely manner, due to the volatile nature of precious metals and the futures contracts used to hedge them, the pricing of the item may be adjusted as necessary to market conditions at the sole discretion of the seller. Deposits accepted at the sole discretion of the seller are deemed non refundable if the balance is not paid as specified by the seller.\\n\\n**\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\***\"},\n",
